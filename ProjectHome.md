# Android Keystore Password Recovery #
A few weeks ago I just forgot the password for my android keystore, so I couldnt update my app for the market. So I decided to code a little bruteforcing tool to recovery my password.


**Java 7 is required to run this tool!!**

**Download now on gdrive, because gcode has deactivated downloads :(**

# Details #
The tool recovers the key for your alias. By default this is the same like the keystore password. ~~I will try to add an option to recover both passwords if they are not equal.~~ Now there is an option to save the key in a new keystore with the same password than the key! You can use this, to sign your apk and update your app in the Playstore.

There are 3 Methods to recover your keystore password:

  1. - Simply Bruteforce
  1. - Dictionary Attack
  1. - Smart Wordlist Attack

In my opinion the last option is the best. You specify some password segments in a textfile. All the segments will be permute and mixed together with numbers.

for example:

your password is: got2loveYa123
in your dictionary should be:
```
got
love
ya
```
Numbers are added automatically. Each word will be added twice, once like you wrote and once with the first letter capitalized, so you just have to write your words once if your are not shure if you first letter was uppercase or lowercase

Good luck
